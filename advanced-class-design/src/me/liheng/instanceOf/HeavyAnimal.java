        b3 has no compilation errors
        because the variable reference is HeavyAnimal, so there could be an Elephant in there.
        This can only be checked at runtime.

        b4 has compilation errors
        because the compiler knows that
        there is no possible way for a Hippo variable reference to be an Elephant.
