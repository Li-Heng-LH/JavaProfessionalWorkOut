#  Design Patterns and Principles

## Some Learning Notes ##

### Functional Interface ###
* contains a single abstract method

&nbsp;

### Lambda Syntax ###
* parentheses can be omitted only if there is exactly one parameter and the data type is not specified
* single expression as the body --> no need {}
* one or more statements in body --> need {}


* the data types for the input parameters of a lambda expression are optional, but
* when one parameter has a data type listed, all parameters must provide a data type.

&nbsp;

### Reference Type ###
* If you use a variable to refer to an object, we can only call the reference type's methods/variables without explicit cast. 
* Reference type determines which methods and variables are accessible to the Java program.

&nbsp;

### Casting ###
* Casting an object from a subclass to a superclass doesnâ€™t require an explicit cast
* Casting an object from a superclass to a subclass requires an explicit cast.
* The compiler will not allow casts to unrelated types. (not related in hierarchy)
* Even when the code compiles without issue, an exception may be thrown at runtime if the object being cast is not actually an instance of that class.

&nbsp;

### Encapsulation ###
* Methods operate on the data, rather than being accessed directly by users.
